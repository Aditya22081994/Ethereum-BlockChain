Consensus Protocol:
-> A secure chain is a single main chain with a consistent state. 
-> Every valid block added to this chain, adds to the trust level of the chain. 
-> The miners are competing to add their block to the chain. 
-> Everyone wants to add their candidate block to the chain.
-> Each of the candidate blocks is by a competing miner.
-> Proof of Work is a method or a protocol to choose the next block.
->  Proof of Work uses hashing.

Proof of Work as used in bitcoin and ethereum:
-> This is from the point of view of the miner. 
-> First, compute the hash of the block header elements that is a fixed value, and a nonce that is a variable.
-> If hash value is less than 2^128 for bitcoin, and less than function of difficulty for ethereum, the puzzle has been solved. 
-> If it has not been solved, repeat the process after changing the nonce value. 
-> If the puzzle has been solved, broadcast the winning block that will be verified by other miners. 
-> Non-winning miner nodes add the new block to the local copy of the chain, and move on to working on the next block.
-> The winner gets an incentive for creating the block. Proof of Work is a consensus protocol used by bitcoin block chain and also by the current version of ethereum.
-> The protocol may be the same, the implementations in these two block chains are different. 
-> Many other approaches such as Proof of Stake, Proof of Elapsed Time have been proposed. 
-> This is a hotly debated area among the developers of blockchain.

Robustness:
-> Trust us not only about executing regular operations correctly but also about managing exception satisfactory. 
-> Robustness is the ability to satisfactorily manage exceptional situations. 
-> It's all the more important in a decentralized autonomous network such as a blockchain where there are no intermediaries minding the store.
-> What if more than one miner solves the consensus puzzle where it close in time to each other? 
-> What if more than one transaction references as input the same digital asset? 
-> This situation is called double spending. 
-> Handling such exception satisfactorily is critical for ensuring the security of the blockchain.
-> For Example, two miners have solved the consensus puzzle very close to each other. 
BitCoin:
-> Bitcoin protocol allows this chain split or two chains for the next cycle. 
-> One led by each of the competing blocks. 
-> The probability that the next block will happen at the same time in both these chains is extremely low. 
-> So the winner of the next cycle for block creation consolidates one of the chains and that chain becomes the accepted chain.
->  In this case, the newest block is added to the main chain. 
-> Now this chain is the longest and the valid main chain.
->  The transaction in the other blocks are returned to the unconfirmed pool.
Ethereum:
-> Ethereum handles more than one person we know by allowing Omar or Runner-Up blocks and allocating a small incentive for these Runner-Up blocks.
-> This incentive model helps in keeping the chains secure.
-> New blocks are added only to the mainchain and not to the Runner-Up chains.
-> The block that's deeper inside the chain is more trustworthy than the one newly added.

Double Spending Problem:
-> There's a possibility that digital currency and other consumables are single used digital assets, can be intentionally or inadvertently reused in transactions.
->  In a decentralized network, like a blockchain, there is no intermediary. 
-> We need a policy and an automatic deterministic way to handle this situation. 
BitCoin:
-> A policy for handling transaction and double spending in Bitcoin is to allow the first transaction that reference the digital asset and reject the rest of the transaction that reference the same digital asset.
Ethereum:
-> In Ethereum, a combination of account number and a global nonce is used to address the doublet spending issue. 
-> Every time a transaction is initiated by an account, a global nonce is included in the transaction. After that, the nonce is incremented.
-> Time stamp and the nonce in the transaction should be unique and verified to prevent any double use of digital asset.
